- If the campaign was successful, how much of that success counld be attributed to the ads?

  ### Insights and conclusion
  - People that was shown the ads were converted the most.
  - The distribution showed the more ads was pushed out on friday and by 1pm. But this doesnt mean that most of the conversions were during this day and hour.
  - Further analysis showed that most ad conversion happened on Monday (3% conversion rate) and by 4pm (3.1% conversion rate)
  - Performing statistical test to determine dependencies between variables is pivotal, and it was generally concluded that there is a significant difference in conversion rate between people shown the ad and people who didn't see the ad (test group variable).
  - There is significant difference in conversion rate for the ad shown in different days and in different hour.
  - Further tests for normality and difference in variance were conducted using shapiro and levene test respectively.
